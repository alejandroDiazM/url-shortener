# URL SHORTENER

Go exercise with a program that takes a URL path and decides if it should be redirected, from localhost.

## Usage:

After cloning the repo, run:

```cmd
go run main/main.go
```

This will start the server on http://localhost:8080

After that's done, the program will take paths and Urls to redirect to in map and yaml format, which you can add to main() inside main.go.
